 # Shape your Mooncake

 ### Mooncake Molds at Mooncakery
 Here's a description of the three molds you can choose from:
1. Narcissus: This mold prints a geometric pattern at the center of a narcissus flower, associated with rebirth. Narcissus flowers can be found in Central Asia and are colored yellow and white.
2. Plum Blossom: This mold stamps the design of a plum blossom flower, a symbol of resilience and perseverance due to their ability to thrive in harsh cold weather.
3. Mid-Autumn lettering: This mold writes ‰∏≠Áßã(zhong qiu), meaning Mid-Autumn in Mandarin. The design also includes leaves to signify the autumn weather!
