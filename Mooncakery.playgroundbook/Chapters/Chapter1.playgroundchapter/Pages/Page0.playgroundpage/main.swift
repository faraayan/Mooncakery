 # Mooncakery
At last our worlds meet under the full moon! 👋
 
 Today is the **Mid-Autumn Festival**, a traditional Southeast asain celebration held on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. The moon is the fullest and brightest during this time which makes for a beautiful scenery.

Every year our family celebrates this day with red paper lanterns 🏮, elaborate dragon dances 🐉, and moon-gazing from the backyard of our home 🌕. But my favorite  part of the Mid-Autumn Festival is when we gather to make and eat **mooncake** 🥮, a round Chinese cake. Mooncakes represent completeness and reunion, an experience connecting me closer to my family and Chinese culture.

  * Callout(Origins of the Mid-Autumn Festival ⌚️):
 The origin of the Mid-Autumn Festival dates back to 1045 – 770 BC in the Zhou Dynasty. Back then, ancient Chinese emperors worshipped the moon in autumn, because they believed their practice would bring them a supple harvest. These ceremonies were commonly attended by high officials and wealthy families during the Autumn Equinox. An appearance of these ceremonies were marked in the famous ancient book Zhou Li, where the word "mid-autumn" first appeared when detailing rituals of the Zhou Dynasty.
