 # Craft the Dough
 The first step to creating a mooncake is to **prepare its dough**. Mooncake dough is soft and tender, similar to the texture of dough in tart shells or quiches.
 
 When you are ready, run the code to create your mooncake dough.
 
   * Callout(The Birth of Mooncakes ðŸ¥®):
  The tradition of mooncakes date back to 618â€“907 AD in the Tang Dynasty. During this time, the practice of moon worship and moon-gazing became a standard routine for commonpeople. People began eating mooncakes in appreciation of the moon for their fall harvest. Nowadays, mooncakes are eaten during family reunions to celebrate togetherness.
