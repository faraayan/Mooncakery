 # Prepare the Filling
On this page you will prepare the mooncake filling. Mooncakes have a sweet, dense filling and may include additional fillings as well. The most common mooncake fillings are red bean paste, lotus seed paste (my favorite ðŸ’–), jujube paste, and five kernels. Mooncake is usually made with salted egg yolks, but can also hold custard or no filling.
 
 * Callout(Mooncakes Around the World ðŸŒŽ): Not only are traditional mooncakes popular during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but many other cultures have also evolved mooncakes into their own styles. In **Indonesia** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©, versions of the mooncake called â€˜bakpiaâ€™ use fillings such as chocolate, cheese, durian, and jackfruit. These pastries were originally introduced by Fujianese immigrants and are now a common treat for friends and families to share. In the **Philippines** ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­, filipinos eat a local mooncake version â€˜hopiaâ€™ filled with pork, ming-bean, and purple yam.
